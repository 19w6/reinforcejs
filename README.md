# reinforcejs

REINFORCEjs is a set of Reinforcement Learning demos, along with a small Javascript library that implements several common algorithms, and is currently maintained by @karpathy. In particular, the library currently includes:

- Dynamic Programming
- (Tabular) Temporal Difference Learning (SARSA/Q-Learning)
- Deep Q-Learning
- Stochastic/Deterministic Policy Gradients (*super alpha, probably buggy*)

See the [main webpage](cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs) for many more details, documentation and demos.
